        <h2 class="text-center text-gray-900">Why choose OPL?</h2>
        <p class="text-center text-gray-800">You may be wondering, why choose OPL over other educational websites such as Khan Academy? One of the main reasons that make OPL unique is that we offer education from students. This is special because our target demographic for our videos are for people just like us, students that are eager to learn. Amidst this pandemic, more teaching is taught online. Students who are less fortunate that do not get adequate education should have another resource at their disposal to learn from, a resource that is very effective at teaching because it is student-made. Peer-to-peer learning reduces the fear of judgement and increases confidence with other learners. With our content, we will be able to closely relate to our audience because we are students just like them, trying to learn more every day.
